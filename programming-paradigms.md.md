# Programming Paradigms

## 1. Imperative

Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state. It's famous by the `goto` expression.

**Languages:**

- **C** : developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson
- **Fortan** : developed by John Backus for IBM
- **Basic**

**Advantages:**

- Very simple to implement
-  It contains loops, variables etc.

**Disadvantages:**

-  Complex problem cannot be solved
-  Less efficient and less productive
- Parallel programming is not possible

## 2. Structured

Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures.

## 3. Procedural

Imperative programming with procedure calls.

**Languages:**

- **C** : developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson
- **C++** : developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
- **Java** : developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
- **ColdFusion** : developed by J J Allaire
- **Pascal** : developed by Niklaus Wirth

## 4. Object-Oriented

Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects have their own internal (encapsulated) state and public interfaces.

**Languages:**

- **Simula** : first OOP language
- **Java** : developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
- **C++** : developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
- **Objective-C** : designed by Brad Cox
- **Visual Basic .NET** : developed by Microsoft
- **Python** : developed by Guido van Rossum
- **Ruby** : developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto 
- **Smalltalk** : developed by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg

**Advantages:**

-   Data security
-   Inheritance
-   Code reusability
-   Flexible and abstraction is also present

### 4.1 Class-based

Objects get state and behavior based on membership in a class.

### 4.2 Prototype-based

Objects get behavior from a prototype object.

## 5. Declarative

Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.

### 5.1 Logical

Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions (rule-based)

### 5.2 Functional

Programming with function calls that avoid any global state (applicative).

**Languages:**

- **JavaScript** : developed by Brendan Eich
- **Haskwell** : developed by Lennart Augustsson, Dave Barton
- **Scala** : developed by Martin Odersky
- **Erlang** : developed by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding
- **Lisp** : developed by John Mccarthy
- **ML** : developed by Robin Milner
- **Clojure** : developed by Rich Hickey

### 5.3 Database Driven

## 6. Reactive

The desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change.

## 7. Honorable Mentions

-   **Function-Level  (Combinator):** Programming with no variables at all.
-   **Event-Driven:** Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.
-   **Flow-Driven:** Programming processes communicating with each other over predefined channels.
-   **Constraint:** Programming by specifying a set of constraints. An engine finds the values that meet the constraints.
-   **Aspect-Oriented:** Programming cross-cutting concerns applied transparently.
-   **Reflective:** Programming by manipulating the program elements themselves.
-   **Array:** Programming with powerful array operators that usually make loops unnecessary.
- **Mathematical:** the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem.
